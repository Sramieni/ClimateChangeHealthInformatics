# Impacts of Climate Change on Vulnerable Populations

## Research Question

This research project explores how climate change affects vulnerable populations with a focus on pregnant women and other high risk groups such as children, the elderly, and low-income communities. The primary question addresses the direct and indirect health impacts of climate related events on these populations.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
- Utilized Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map risk factors and vulnerabilities.
- Integrated data from various sources including meteorology, geography, public health, and socioeconomics.
- Employed real-time data processing from satellites, weather stations, and healthcare records.

### Analysis Techniques
- Conducted multivariate analyses to assess the impacts of environmental stressors like extreme weather events on health outcomes.
- Analyzed data related to food and water security, disease spread, and environmental hazards.

### Tools Used
- QGIS for mapping and data integration.

## Findings

### Key Insights
- Identified significant correlations between climate related events and adverse health outcomes in pregnant women and infants.
- Extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, exacerbating existing health disparities.
- Food insecurity due to climate impacts poses a critical risk for birth defects and other pregnancy related complications.

### Implications
- The findings underline the urgent need for integrated health strategies and robust infrastructure to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on vulnerable populations.

## Contributions

### Personal Contributions
- Led the GIS mapping initiative, identifying key areas of vulnerability and strategic points for intervention.
- Coordinated the integration of diverse data types, ensuring comprehensive analysis and reporting.

### Collaborative Efforts
- Contributed to the writing and reviewing of the final project, highlighting key findings and recommendations.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the critical intersections between climate change and public health. Our findings advocate for proactive measures to protect the most vulnerable populations through improved policy, education, and infrastructure.
